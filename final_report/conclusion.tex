\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we describe I/O dependent branch bugs that arise when control
flow decisions are dependent on variables tainted by non-idempotent reads in an
intermittent execution.
%
We describe how prior system support for intermittent execution allows
memory to remain in an inconsistent state by persisting writes along multiple
branches. Then we present an LLVM pass that identifies potential I/O dependent
branch bugs and warns the programmer. We further describe a filter for reducing the
number of false positives produced by the pass.
%
We run the tool on three different suites of code for embedded systems
to identify how the bug manifests in the real code. Finally, we present three
case studies demonstrating how the tool identified bugs in real code from the
TI-RTOS code base.
