FunctionInfo: This directory contains the analysis pass. Run "make" to compile
the pass.

LocalOpts: This directory contains LocalOpts.cpp which contains all three
optimization passes. The optimizations are as follows:

1. Algebraic identities: Handles addition by zero, multipliation and division by 1 and
division and subtraction by an equal number. 
(ex: a + 0 = a, a * 1 = a, a / 1 = a, a / a = 1, a -a = 0)

2. Constant Folding: folds constants that are in expressions containing
addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. The optimizaiton also
propagates the variables that have been defined with constants.

3. Strength reduction: converts divsion and multiplication by integer powers of
2 to bit shifts.
